# Rest and Spread Operators Exercise

Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice the rest and spread operators. 🏹

As the lead engineer 🧑‍🔬 in the Wildlife Oasis 🐘, you manage the sanctuary's database of endangered species using advanced JavaScript techniques.

Your tasks are:

1. **Track Animal Sightings**: Write a function with rest parameters to print sightings of different animals within the sanctuary. This function should accept an arbitrary number of animal names.
2. **Merge Habitat Areas**: You are given two arrays of habitat names. Use the spread operator to combine them into a comprehensive list of protected areas within the sanctuary.
3. **Update Conservation Status**: You are given an object representing an animal's conservation status. Use the spread operator to update this status with new information, such as an increase in population or a change in habitat.
4. **Catalog Genetic Diversity**: Duplicate an animal profile object using a shallow copy. Add genetic diversity information using the `genetics` property to this copy. Observe and explain how changes to nested properties affect both the original and the copied object.
5. **Analyze Ecosystem Health**: You are given an object with a nested structure detailing the ecosystem's health, including water quality and food supply. Perform a shallow copy and modify a nested property. Observe and explain how changes to nested properties affect both the original and the copied object.

In the starter code, we left TODOs for you. Those are the places where you will implement the above tasks.
